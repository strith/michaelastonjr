- Welcome to my portfolio. You will find a bit of information about myself and my work over the years.
- This site uses the Devias Kit template from the Material UI library. That means a good chunk of what's here came from that library and the template.
- You are free to use this however you want just be sure to attribute the Devias license for the template.
