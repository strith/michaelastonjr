## Michael Aston Portfolio

- Welcome to my portfolio. You will find a bit of information about myself and my work over the years.
  additionally you will be able to get a glimpse of my code; however, it is worth noting two things.
- This site uses the Devias Kit template from the Material UI library. That means a good chunk of what's here
  came from that library and the template.
- I wrote this code fairly quickly and focused more on getting the inforamation onto the page
  rather than ensuring I had the perfect solution as if I was going to deploy this to a production site
  and chage customers.
- This might be a bit overengineered for a personal resume/portfolio site, but it
  isn't, and doesn't intend to try to be a corparate/enterprise level website. I would do
  many things differently on a professional site. Not the least of which is that I would
  include unit tests to cover my code.
- You are free to use this however you want no attribution or anything is needed
  for my efforts, but you still need to attribute the Devias license (which is
  to say that they made the template).
